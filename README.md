<strong>About</strong><br>
<br>
PDF merger brings two PDF files together using following steps: <br>
1. The program asks user to enter the names of two PDF files<br>
2. User then decides whether to append second file to the first file or insert the second file at the specific page of the first file <br>
3. Using pathlib, the program searches user's OS for PDF files, and merges the files together<br>
<br>
<strong>Limitations</strong><br>
<br>
-Because the program lacks GUI and is run from command prompt, user must be careful of spelling when entering names of the PDF files<br>
-The names of the files must include extensions (.pdf)<br>
-Only two files can be merged
